# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Airfoil-Optimization-in-Transonic-Regime

Steps to run:
1. Open "optimizer.py" file
2. Set the optimization parameters (such as number of population, number of generation, p crossover, and p mutation)
3. Set the lower bound and upper bound of design variables, i.e. PARSEC parameters and angle of attack.
4. Open "calcFunc.py" file
5. Set the constraint parameters, i.e. lift coefficient, pitching moment coefficient, and airfoil thickness.
6. Run "optimizer.py"

Required Python libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. matplotlib
